# Flask_app
This is a flask app example. The app enables a user to log in and check their favorite color. If the user does not exist , they have an option to login and their data will be apppended into the database using some predefined SQL code.
Once logged in the user is able to see their favorite color and they have an option to log out. Once they log out, they are redirected back to the homepage.
All this is done via a virtual linux server. You  need some basic knowledge of the terminal in order to be able to run this code.
